# Tilt Turn (Ground)
A movement mod for VR hoverboarding/jetpacking/grapple-hooking masterpiece [Jet Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/587220/Jet_Island/). Tilt Turn enables players without full-body tracking to turn their hoverboard by tilting their head left and right, similar to directing a snowboard or skis. Higher speeds enable tighter turning, so don't be afraid to use those jets to zoom around on the ground!

Compatible with both standard mode and Extreme Spin mode. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://mods.jet-is.land/how-to-install/).
