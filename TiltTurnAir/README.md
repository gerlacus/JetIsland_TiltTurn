# Tilt Turn (Air)
A movement mod for VR hoverboarding/jetpacking/grapple-hooking masterpiece [Jet Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/587220/Jet_Island/). Tilt Turn enables players without full-body tracking to turn their hoverboard while airborne by tilting their head left and right, similar to directing a snowboard or skis. Higher speeds enable tighter turning, so don't be afraid to use those jets and pull off some big jumps!

Compatible with both standard mode and Extreme Spin mode. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://mods.jet-is.land/how-to-install/).

Want to control your board on the ground too? Check out [Tilt Turn (Ground)](https://github.com/gerlacus/JetIsland_TiltTurn/tree/master/TiltTurnGround)!
